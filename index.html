        <h2 id="components"><i>Core Components of Your Machine</i></h2>
        <p id="body1">The core components of any PC or laptop consist of the CPU, GPU, RAM and the storage. The CPU is the brains of the operation meaning it controls everything that the computer does is controlled by the CPU. A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly process and render images, animations, and video. Think of it as an expert assistant to the Central Processing Unit (CPU).The RAM (Random Access Memory) it provides fast access to data, allowing the CPU to retrieve information quickly, similar to a physical desk where you keep frequently used items within reach.A storage device is a piece of computer hardware used to record, store, and retrieve digital information for later use. These devices, which can be internal or external, range from traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) to modern Solid State Drives (SSDs), USB drives, and cloud-based solutions, each offering different capacities and speeds for permanent or temporary data retention</p>

            <p><strong>Here are some fun facts about computer hardware</strong>The first computer mouse was made out of wood. The first webcam was used to monitor a coffee pot. The term "bug" originated when an actual moth caused a malfunction</p>

            <h2 id="head3"><i>Performance of Different Components</i></h2>
            <p id="body-performance">It's hard to really narrow down performance not knowing what components will be used but to give an example Intel's most popular processors vary from time to time but the Core i9-14900K and Core i7-14700K are top-performing desktop options for demanding tasks and gaming.The Core i9-14900K's frame rates vary significantly by game, but with a high-end GPU like an RTX 4080, you can expect well over 100 FPS. On the other hand you have AMD cpus a direct competitor with intel. One of the most popular AMD CPUs is the ryzen 9 9950x3d,and it provides a notable advantage over competing Intel CPUs at 1080p and 1440p.The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 is currently the most powerful consumer GPU available, featuring the Blackwell architecture and offering unprecedented AI horsepower, full ray tracing, and low latency for gamers and creators. It provides a significant performance leap over its predecessor, the RTX 4090, though it comes with a very high price tag and requires substantial power.</p>

            <div>
                <p><strong>Fun Facts On Device Performance</strong>The cooler, the better: When a device's processor gets too hot, it intentionally slows itself down to prevent hardware damage. This protective mechanism is called thermal throttling.Exposing your device to high temperatures, such as leaving it in a hot car, accelerates battery degradation. High temperatures cause the liquid electrolytes inside the battery to break down, reducing its long-term capacity.</p>

  <section id="pricing">
    <h2 id="head4"><i>Pricing</i></h2>
    <p id="body-price">Prices for computer parts can vary depending on market value. Its basic supply and demand when there is more supply and less demand prices go down but when theres low supply and high demand prices go up. Due top this depending on performance and brand a mid-range build can typically cost between $500 and $1,500 for components, with prices potentially going up to $2,500 or more for high-end systems. Key components like the Graphics Card (GPU) and CPU will make up the largest portion of the cost, with a powerful GPU potentially ranging from $200 to over $1,000. RAM can vary depending on what your system will be used for. If it will be used for light casual gaming 16gb is perfect. For more intense gaming thewn 32gb would be better, for office work 16gb will suffice</p>

        <div>
            <p><strong>Fun Facts On Hardware Pricing</strong>Computers used to be incredibly expensive, with one model costing over $500,000 in today's money, while a basic one today can be found for just a few hundred dollars. Today's most powerful computers can also perform tasks millions of times faster than early machines that took up entire rooms, making powerful technology accessible and affordable for most people</p>
